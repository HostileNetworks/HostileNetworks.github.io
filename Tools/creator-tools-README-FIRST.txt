Use the Creator Tools ONLY to modify the modpack json (via "Modify" button on toolbar, or Right-click > Edit modpack.json).

I have made some custom changes to the way our launcher works with json files which the Creator tools are not updated for.

You don't really need the Creator Tools jar at all - just edit JSON's manually (excluding the distrib ones) and use update_Reign.cmd script as needed.

For new modpacks, you can compare Reign and Forge 1.7.10 json/cmd files to get an idea.
